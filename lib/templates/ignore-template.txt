# ignore files
#
# An ignore file is used to hide items from an ical calendar.   Event names are
# compared to each line and if there is a match, that item is not displayed.
#
#  Events are compared in a case insensitive manner (so "Hold", "HOLD", and "hold" all match)
#
#  You can also use * and ? wildcards (* matches any # of chars, and ? matches any single char)
#
#  Whether or not Private meetings are displayed is NOT controlled by this file, but
#  by the argument to the draw_calendar() command in a display configuration file.
