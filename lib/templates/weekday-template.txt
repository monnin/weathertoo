#  weekday files
#
#  "weekday" files contain items that regularly rotate (but skips weekend days). 
# 
#  If you want to skip a day, enter only a hypen (-) on the day, and no information
#  will be displayed on that day.
#
#  You can also add a line in the form:
#
#       offset=###
# 
#  To shift which event happens today without changing the other lines.  Any positive
#  or negative number can be used to increment/decrement which item is the active item
#  for today.
