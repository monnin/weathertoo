# countdown files
#
#
#  A countdown file can be used to show how many days until a number of events.
#
#	A typical line looks like:
#
#	mm/dd/yyyy Event Name
#   mm/dd      Event Name 2
#
#  Each line represents a specific event, and can include the year (to show once)
#  or without the year if the countdown is shown every year.
#
#  DAYS:
#
#  A line of "days=###" controls how many days in advance will the subsequent
#  events will show (with a default of 7 days if the line is not present).
#
#  A file can contain multiple "days=###" lines, as each only affects the entries
#  AFTER the line.
#
#  MULTIYEAR:
#
#  Additionally, countdown files have a special format (by starting the line with an
#  astersisk (*) by using the "multiyear=1" line.  With multiyear, the year is
#  ignored when computing if the event is upcoming or not, but also the letters "nth"
#  in an event name is replaced with the "1st", "2nd", "3rd", etc. as necessary.
#
#   (e.g. *10/10/2020  John's nth Birthday)
