home:
    <p>Welcome to the control panel for the weather display.   If this is
    the first time using the device, please start with the
    <a href="/init">Intial Setup</a> and work through the various
    configuration menus.</p>
    
init:
    This is where you enter the parameters that are normally only
    needed to be set once.
    
                             
loc:
    <p>Enter the the location you wish to show the weather for.  This
    becomes the default location, and can be overridden when in
    the display section to show multiple
    weather sites.</p>
     
    <p>You can enter your location 
    as <b>either</b> your street address <b>or</b> your latitude and longitude.
    The street address is not stored and is only used to look up your
    latitude and longitude.</p>

weather:
    <p>In this section, select which of NOAA's observation stations
    you wish.  You can select multiple locations, and the system
    will use the first one that has valid data.</p>
    
    You can also configure what watch area ("zones") that you
    wish to monitor for NOAA alerts.  This can be either a specific
    small zone or a (larger) county-wide zone.</p>
     
    <p>Finally, you can select which location ("Tide Port") to use
    when reporting the local tide</p>

email_addr:
    The program uses a NOAA web-based API to retrieve weather data.
    NOAA requires an email address be part of the web requests so it
    can notify you if the program is misbehaving (which shouldn't happen).
    The program does not use your email address in any other manner.
                                                  
timezone:
     Given in Linux timezone format (e.g. "America/New_York").

lat_lon:
     Your latitude and longitude to use as the location for various
     weather data.  The two (floating point) numbers are seperated by a
     comma with latitude first (e.g.  43.6795, -70.444 for Gorham, Maine, US).

addr:
    This is your street address followed by the city name and
    state (for US locations).  You do not have to specify the
    zip code.

wifi_ssid:
    This is the network "name" for you Wi-Fi network.

wifi_pass:
     This is the "password" (key) for your Wi-Fi network.  For
     security purposes, it is not shown in the control panel
     after it stored.

forecast_zone:
     This is the name (given by weather.gov) to represent your
     a small zone that includes your (default) location.  It has the
    form of three-letters, a forward slash, and then two integers
    (representing a portion of the location).  (e.g. GYX/68.40)

     <p>Only one (default) forecast zone is permitted. This becomes
     the default location for all weather output, but can be
     overridden in the display section if you wish to show the
     weather for multiple locations.</p>


alert_zone:
     The weather display can show weather alerts for a specific
     zone or for the entire county that you are located in.
     Zones typically start with a two letter abbreviation for
     the state, followed by a "Z" for a zone (smaller than a
     county) or "C" (for the entire county).

obs_stations:
     This is an <b>ordered</b> list of observation stations to
     look up currect conditions on.  Due to the way the stations
     provide data, the primary location might not have current
     data, and then the subsequent observation station is used.
     <p>Each station has the form of a US callsign, and typically
     are four characters, starting with a "K".</p>

tide_station:
     This is the location (e.g. a port) to look up information
     about high and low tides.  The tide station is given as
     an (integer) number.  Only one tide station is permitted.
     
calendar:
    Use this page to control how the calendar section of the display.
    If you do not intend to use the calendar functions at this time, you do not
    need to configure anything here.

ical:
    <p>You can allow the display to look at one or more remote calendars,
    as long as they use the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar">ical</a>
    Apple, Google, and Microsoft all support the ical format.</p>
    <p>You may enter multiple ical URLs in a file (one URL per line)
    and/or use multiple files.</p>


ignore:
    These files control which calendar events are not displayed by
    comparing the calendar description against wildcarded strings.
    For instance, placing a line that says "<b>hold*</b>" will stop any
    calendar event that starts with the word hold from displaying.

ignore-2:
    The lines can use a Unix/Linux-style wildcarding, so a "a*b" would
    match all events starting with an <b>a</b> and ending with a <b>b</b>,
    while the question mark (<b>?</b>) is used to match a single character.
    Additionally, all comparisons are case-insensitive (so the titles
    "hold" and "HOLD" would match).

daily:
    These files control recurring events that  have a rotation other than
    on specific days (including both weekday and weekends).  One example
    might be a simple rotation of who's turn it is to make or cleanup dinner.
                                                  
weekday:
    These files control recurring events that happen on Monday-Friday
    only (hence "weekday") and might have a rotation other than
    on specific days.  One example might be a K12 school calendar that
    has "core" days that occur in a 6-day cycle.

weekday-2:
    <p>The line <b>offset = ##</b> is used to change the starting point
    of the sequence, and can be <i>any</i> positive or negative number.
    The number does <b>not</b> have to be in the
    range of the number of events.</p>
                                                        
    <p>If the calendar is <i>behind</i> by one day, just increase the
    offset by one.  If the calendar is <i>ahead</i> by a day, subtract
    one of the current offset (which is where negative numbers could
    be useful).</p>

countdown:
    Countdown files contain lines that cause the calendar to
    indicate the number of days until that event (e.g. "5 days until Chrismas").
    The format is the date, followed by the event name.   If the date does
    not have a year, the countdown will happen each year.

countdown-2:
    <p>The <b>days = ##</b> line instructs the system to show the events
    <i>following</i> that line with that many days in advance (with the default
    being 7 days.  The <b>days</b> line can occur multiple times in a
    single configuration file.</p>

    <p>The line <b>multiyear = true</b> changes the behaviour if a year
    is present in the date.  When <b>multiyear</b> is enabled, the event
    occurs every year and the literal word <b>nth</b> in the event name
    is changed
    to the appropriate designation (e.g. 1st, 2nd, 3rd).</p>
                                                  
edit:
    <p>Like all configuration files, you can place comments within the
    files by starting
    with the
    pound sign (<b>#</b>).  Comments can be at the start of the
    line or at the end of line.  Additionally, blank lines in the
    file are ignored.

active:
    This is the active display template.  Only one display template can be chosen
    at any given time.   If the network is not connected, the system will use a
    <b>special</b> template and not this one.

screen:
    These are the templates used to change what information is displayed on
    the screen and what format.   You can either use one of the default templates,
    or create your own.

display:
   These are the templates that you have created (or have copied from the
   provided templates.   These are optional.  You do not need to create a display
   template, but instead can use on of the pre-built templates instead.

sys-display:
   These are the templates that come bundled with the program.   You may
   edit these by creating a copy of one (or more) of them first.  The (editable) copies
   will then appear in the "Your Display Templates" section.

iconset:
    <p><b>Icon Sets</b> are used to alter the pictures displayed with
    various weather conditions and forecast.   They convert a condition
    (e.g. "bkn" or "day-bkn") into a given SVG filename.  These are optional.
    You do not have to
    create your own Icon Sets if you do not wish to, and can use the pre-built
    icon sets (or chose no set to use the official NOAA icons).</p>
    <p>If no match is encountered, the version from the NOAA website is used.</p>

sys-iconset:
    These are the icon sets that are bundled with the program.  You may
   edit these by creating a copy of one (or more) of them first.  The (editable) copies
   will then appear in the "Your Icon Sets" section.

backres-restart:
   After a restore, you may want to restart the programs.  Additionally,
   the Wi-Fi password is never stored in the backup, so you might have to re-enter
   it after any restore that affects changes the network settings.

rotate:
   How the screen is (digitally) rotated prior to displaying on the e-Paper screen.  This
   does not affect how the screen is shown in the "Preview Display" setting.

sync:
   <p>This is optional and <b>only</b> necessary if you wish to run more than one displays and
   have the configuration copied from one display to other displays.  This is
   done by regularly copying config files from a remote display if it has
   been updated.  You can choose to keep all files in sync, keep all files
   of a specific type in sync, or choose individual files.</p>
   <p>Enter the IP address (or DNS name) of the display you wish to copy the files from,
   and possibly followed by an equals sign (=), and then followed by the remote display's <i>sync</i>
   password.  Sync passwords are not the same as the password you use to view the web page).</p>
   <p>You can sync from a single unit or chose to copy files from multiple
   sources.  However, it always recommended to have the sync operations
   go in a single direction.</p>
   <p><i>Note:</i> Sync works best when the source system has a IP address that
   does not change (e.g., the source display has a static DHCP entry).</p>

password:
   Use this page to change the <b>web</b> password (aka the one you used to get to this page).  This is different than
   the password used between two displays that are keeping the configuration files synchronized.

web_password:
   Enter a new password to use to access this web site.  It is stored in a semi-secure method ("hashed").

sync_password:
   <p>This is the password that other displays will use to read this device's configuration files
   as well as the default password if no password is given in the configuration lines.  Make
   it <b>different</b> than the web password.  You do not need to set it if this system will not be the
   <b>source</b> of configuration changes. </p>
   <p><i>Warning:</i> It is not stored in a secure manner, so do not reuse this password from any other account.</p>
  
sync_server:
   Do you want the files on this display to be available to other displays?  If you enter "No", you still can (use
   the password to) copy files from other displays to this display.

sync-w-all:
    Copy ALL files from the remote display.
	
sync-w-base:
    Keep the forecast zone, alert zone, tide location, web password, latitude and longitude the same as the remote display.

sync_cleanwildcards:
    (Only for sync destinations): For the wildcard Do you want to remove any
    local file that does not have a corresponding file on the remote server?
